        <h2>The Bard's Words: How Shakespeare Enriched the English Language</h2>
        <p>William Shakespeare, the Bard of Avon, is renowned not only for his timeless plays and sonnets but also for his profound impact on the English language. It's estimated that Shakespeare introduced or popularized over <strong>1,700 words</strong> that are still in common use today. His linguistic creativity knew no bounds; he masterfully coined new words by converting nouns to verbs, verbs to adjectives, connecting words never before used together, adding prefixes and suffixes, and simply inventing entirely new terms.</p>

        <p>This incredible lexical expansion wasn't just a matter of quantity. Shakespeare's new words often filled gaps in the language, allowing for more nuanced and precise expression. Think of words like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alligator</strong> (from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Bedroom</strong> (from <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Critic</strong> (from <em>Love's Labour's Lost</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Eyeball</strong> (from <em>Henry VI Part 1</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Fashionable</strong> (from <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Gossip</strong> (as a verb, from <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Hurry</strong> (from <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Lonely</strong> (from <em>Coriolanus</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Manager</strong> (from <em>Love's Labour's Lost</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Rant</strong> (from <em>Hamlet</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Skim milk</strong> (from <em>Henry IV Part 1</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Worthless</strong> (from <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Zany</strong> (from <em>Love's Labour's Lost</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just a few examples of the everyday words we owe to Shakespeare. He didn't just write stories; he sculpted the very language we use to tell them. His ability to capture the human condition was matched by his ability to craft the words needed to express it. So, the next time you use a word like "fashionable" or "eyeball," you're echoing the linguistic genius of William Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>His plays and poems are a testament to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of language, and his contributions continue to enrich our vocabulary centuries later.</p>
